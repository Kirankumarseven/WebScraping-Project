#Web Scraping for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME) Data:

In this project, we use web scraping techniques to extract historical stock data and revenue information for Tesla (TSLA) and GameStop (GME) from financial websites. By utilizing Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and pandas, we fetch the stock price and revenue data for these companies. The stock data is scraped from sources like Yahoo Finance or similar platforms, where we extract details such as the date, open price, close price, volume, and more. Revenue data, typically available in quarterly reports, is also scraped and processed to clean any unwanted characters (e.g., commas or dollar signs).

# The project demonstrates:

Scraping financial data: Extracting stock price and revenue from relevant tables on a financial website.
Data cleaning: Removing non-numeric characters from the revenue column (e.g., dollar signs, commas).
Storing data: Saving the cleaned data into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis or visualization.
This web scraping technique can be customized to scrape data for other companies as well and is foundational for gathering financial data for analysis.
